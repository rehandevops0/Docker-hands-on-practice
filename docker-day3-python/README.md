# Docker Day 3 – Python App Containerization 🐳🐍

## Objective
Create a simple Python application, build a Docker image, and run it as a container to understand Dockerfile, image layers, and immutability.

## Files
- `app.py` – Simple Python application
- `Dockerfile` – Instructions to build the Docker image

## Steps Performed
1. Created a Python app
2. Wrote a Dockerfile using `python:3.9-slim`
3. Built Docker image using `docker build`
4. Ran container using `docker run`
5. Modified app and rebuilt image to understand immutability

## Output

Hello from Docker Day 3 🚀


## Key Concepts Learned
- Dockerfile instructions
- Image layers
- Immutability
- CMD vs RUN
